Welcome to the **Real-Time Image Edge Detection Using OpenCV** project, hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/umairrrkhan/Real-Time-Image-Edge-Detection-Using-OpenCV). This application uses OpenCV and Gradio to detect edges in images using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

## 🚀 Demo
Check out the live demo of the project here: [Real-Time Image Edge Detection](https://huggingface.co/spaces/umairrrkhan/Real-Time-Image-Edge-Detection-Using-OpenCV).

## 📝 Description

This project implements a Real-Time Image Edge Detection application using OpenCV. It processes uploaded images and applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to highlight the edges in the image.

### Features:
- Upload any image to see the edge detection in action.
- Simple and user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.
- Provides a real-time experience of how edge detection works.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Use the interface to upload an image.
2. **Edge Detection**: The app converts the image to grayscale and applies Canny edge detection.
3. **View the Output**: The processed image with highlighted edges is displayed.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and edge detection.
- **Gradio**: For creating a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Hosting platform for deploying the application.

## 📜 How to Use

1. Click the link to visit the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/umairrrkhan/Real-Time-Video-Edge-Detection-Using-OpenCV).
2. Upload an image using the interface.
3. The edges in the image will be detected and displayed in real-time.

## 📦 Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages, which are automatically installed when deploying on Hugging Face:

```bash
gradio opencv-python
```
